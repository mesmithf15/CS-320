How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

When it comes to my code, programs, or software, making sure to follow proper coding guidelines will help to make sure that my code is functional. Also making the code clean and easy to follow, reducing redundancy in code, can help make sure the code if functional. When it comes to being secure, making sure to incorporate proper tests that will help to add security to the code.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When it comes to user needs, making sure to communicate with the client will help to make sure that what is wanted in the program is incorporated. Also, while coding what is interpreted from the user, I also will need to be ready to iterate multiple times, as with the tests, I take the clients input from the current run and then change what is needed to fit the clients wanted design.

How do I approach designing software?

When it comes to my approach on designing software, being open to iterating is a key mindset that I will need to have when making the software. Then taking what the client gives me and through communication verifying wanted results, as I then create the code for the software, the tests that will be run will need to be holistic, and cover the wanted outcomes as well as testing to make sure to test how the software responds to incorrect outcomes. Making sure to follow proper coding guidelines will also be apart of the designing process, so that fellow programmers will be able to follow and make changes if need be.
